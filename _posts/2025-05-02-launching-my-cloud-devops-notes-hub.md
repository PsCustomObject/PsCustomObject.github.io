After months of collecting learning materials, writing study plans, and documenting hands-on experiments in Markdown, I decided it was time to structure and publish my technical notes as a proper GitHub Pages site.

🎉 **It's live here**: [Terraforming My Career](https://pscustomobject.github.io/terraforming-my-career/)

## 📘 What You’ll Find

The new site currently includes:

- 🛠 **Terraform**: from getting started to change management and teardown
- 📚 **Learning Plans**: a structured timeline to guide my Cloud & DevOps path
- 🐳 Sections for **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS** (in progress)
- 📖 **Reading Notes** from books like _Terraform: Up & Running_

Everything is structured in folders, rendered with [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/), and completely searchable.

## 🔍 Why I’m Doing This

I believe in learning in public. Publishing my notes helps me:

- Stay accountable to my learning goals
- Give back to others walking a similar path
- Build writing discipline and clarity of thought

Over time, this space will grow into a personal knowledge base and lab journal — and you're welcome to follow along.
